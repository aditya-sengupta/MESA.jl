# MESA.jl
Julia utilities for the MESA stellar evolution package. Originally developed as part of ASTR 220A: Stars and Planets I, at UC Santa Cruz.

This includes:

- a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram live-plotting utility similar to pgplot
- convenience functions for generating plots from history.data/profile.data files.

This is in a very early stage of development and needs some rewriting for general usability, but I hope it's useful!
